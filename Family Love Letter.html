                            <h2>By Megan LaCoss</h2>
                            <h3> I'd be lost without you.</h3>
                        </center>
                        <p>It’s hard to put into words exactly how thankful I am for you and everything you’ve ever done for me. I was truly blessed with the most amazing family in the world. Life without you guys wouldn’t be the same and neither would I. There’s never a time I couldn’t count on you guys. You’re my support system, my rock and my life. You believe in me, even when I don’t believe in myself. You cheer me on and push me even when I want to give up. You are the reason I am who I am today.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We’ve been through a lot in our lives, but without each other we wouldn’t have made it over the traitorous mountains of obstacles. I couldn’t imagine my life without a family like ours. A family that is so unique, giving, caring, dysfunctional and loving. A family who will love you unconditionally no matter what. A family who will always have your back, cheer you on, support you and do anything to make you happy. It is because of my family that I have the strength to grow, take chances, and live, because I knew they were always behind me every step of the way. It is because of them that I was shaped into the person I am today and will continue to be. I was blessed with so many amazing role models to look up to, with a handful of life advice and the ability to spread my wings and fly off into the world on my own to find myself. I was never told who to be, or what to do. I was guided through life and when it was finally time to fly I was ready, And I only have my family to thank for that.
                        </p>
                        <p>Thank you for everything you’ve ever done for me and ever taught me. Thank you for teaching me the importance of my family. Thank you for teaching me to care and to have a giving heart. Thank you for teaching me to laugh, because after all laughter is the best medicine. Thank you for teaching me to work hard in life, because it will pay off. Thank you for teaching me that it’s okay to fail, to fall and hit a dead end, but never give up. After all, it’s the failure and mistakes that teach us in life. Thank you for being my biggest support, cheerleaders and always believing in me. Thank you for being a phone call away and a shoulder to cry on. Thank you for helping me fly on my own. Thank you for teaching me how to love unconditionally, and most of all thank you for loving me unconditionally no matter what..</p>

                            <h2> By: Sophia Pizzola</h2>
                            <h3> Roses are red, violets are blue, I love you!

                            </h3>

                        <p>Dear Mom and Dad,

                            <p> You guys are the best parents a girl could ask for, and this year, I am making you guys my valentines. I would like to start this buy saying thank you. Thank you making me the person I am today. Thank you for providing me the beautiful home we live in, my loud and obnoxious sisters, and for all the love you have given me. Thank you for teaching me how important family is, and for moving us to a town where we can be close to everyone. And lastly, thank you for always being there for me and my sisters, even though we can be brats and fight all the time.</p>

                            <p> I love you because you taught me to be humble and appreciate everything I have. After leaving home and meeting people from all different backgrounds, I appreciate you so much more. You have always supported me in everything I have done. You have taught me to appreciate what I have, and not envy other’s peoples things. You taught me to not out people down in order to make myself feel better, or look down on people who have less than me.</p>

                            <p> I love you because you made our family so close knit, and I wouldn’t want it any other way. You made us turn off the TV and sit down for family dinner every night, unless Avatar: The Last Air bender was on. You had us go to grandma’s and grandpa’s for a family dinner every Sunday and visit with our amazing grandparents. You made sure that we knew our heritage, and what it meant to you and your family. You taught me how important having a family and a support system to lean on is, and for that, I am forever grateful.</p>

                            <p> I love you because you have always put on a brave face for me and my sisters. You always have provided us with a safe home. When things got scary, whether it be potential job loss or a family member sick, you always made it seem like you had everything under control. You never let your weaknesses show, and that always made me feel safe.</p>

                            <p> I love you because you make me happy. Dad is always making weird jokes and Mom thinks he’s the most hilarious person in the world, and that makes me happy. Seeing you together makes me happy since not everyone has parents who are still so happy together. You make me happy because you will always eat the food left on my plate if I feel bad for not eating it. And speaking of food, you always make food that caters to all our different tastes. If one person doesn’t like the food we are eating, you will make them something different.</p>
