                            <h1>Oscar Wilde to Lord Alfred Douglas</h1>
                            <h3> Oscar Wilde is undoubtedly one of the greatest, and most celebrated, writers of all time– prolific in spite of the enormous indignities he was subjected to throughout his short life. Imprisoned multiple times for the ‘crime’ of homosexuality, Wilde became bankrupt and died in impoverished exile in Paris, aged 46. His ‘sinful,’ forbidden love for English author and poet Lord Alfred Douglas informed much of his work, and Wilde’s profound feelings are beautifully expressed in his letters to Lord Douglas, republished in Oscar Wilde: A Life in Letters. In January of 1893, Wilde wrote:</h3>

                        My Own Boy,<br><br>

                        <p>Your sonnet is quite lovely, and it is a marvel that those red rose-leaf lips of yours should be made no less for the madness of music and song than for the madness of kissing. Your slim gilt soul walks between passion and poetry. I know Hyacinthus, whom Apollo loved so madly, was you in Greek days.</p>

                        <p>Why are you alone in London, and when do you go to Salisbury? Do go there to cool your hands in the grey twilight of Gothic things, and come here whenever you like. It is a lovely place and lacks only you; but go to Salisbury first.</p>

                        Always, with undying love, yours, <br>

                        Oscar

                            <h1>Johnny Cash to June Carter Cash</h1>
                            <h3> The soulful tunes of Johnny Cash are celebrated around the world, but recently a note from the famous singer-songwriter to his wife, June Carter Cash, has topped a poll of the greatest love letters of all time. The couple shared more than thirty years of marriage, and their enduring love was a central theme of the 2005 biopic Walk the Line. Below is the letter Johnny Cash wrote to his wife on her 65th birthday. Caution: this might make you weep at your desk.</h3>

                        Happy Birthday Princess,<br><br>

                        We know what the other wants without asking. Sometimes we irritate each other a little bit. Maybe sometimes take each other for granted.<br><br>

                        But once in awhile, like today, I meditate on it and realize how lucky I am to share my life with the greatest woman I ever met. You still fascinate and inspire me. You influence me for the better. You’re the object of my desire, the #1 Earthly reason for my existence. I love you very much.<br><br>

                        Happy Birthday Princess.

                        John
